      # Mount your workspace directory to /projects inside the container
      # Example: mount your local /workspace to /projects inside the container
      - /Users/webdevcody/Workspace/automaker-workspace:/projects:rw

      # ===== CLI Authentication (Optional) =====
      # Mount host CLI credentials to avoid re-authenticating in container

      # Claude CLI - mount your ~/.claude directory (Linux/Windows)
      # This shares your 'claude login' OAuth session with the container
      # - ~/.claude:/home/automaker/.claude

      # Cursor CLI - mount your ~/.cursor directory (Linux/Windows)
      # This shares your 'cursor-agent login' OAuth session with the container
      # - ~/.cursor:/home/automaker/.cursor

      # OpenCode CLI - mount your ~/.local/share/opencode directory
      # This shares your 'opencode auth login' session with the container
      # - ~/.local/share/opencode:/home/automaker/.local/share/opencode
      # - ~/.config/opencode:/home/automaker/.config/opencode

      # ===== Playwright Browser Cache (Optional) =====
      # Playwright Chromium is PRE-INSTALLED in the Docker image for automated testing.
      # Uncomment below to persist browser cache across container rebuilds (saves ~300MB download):
      # - playwright-cache:/home/automaker/.cache/ms-playwright
      #
      # To update Playwright browsers manually:
      #   docker exec --user automaker -w /app automaker-server npx playwright install chromium
    environment:
      # Set root directory for all projects and file operations
      # Users can only create/open projects within this directory
      - ALLOWED_ROOT_DIRECTORY=/projects
      - NODE_ENV=development

      # ===== macOS Users =====
      # On macOS, OAuth tokens are stored in SQLite databases, not plain files.
      # Extract your Cursor token with: ./scripts/get-cursor-token.sh
      # Then set it here or in your .env file:
      # - CURSOR_API_KEY=${CURSOR_API_KEY:-}

volumes:
  # Playwright cache volume - optional, persists browser updates across container rebuilds
  # Uncomment if you mounted the playwright-cache volume above
  # playwright-cache:
  #   name: automaker-playwright-cache
